    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bibimbap, a warm Korean rice bowl topped with veggies and meat, is a filling meal that’s always a good idea to eat. This dish has alot of variety in it, namely the kimchi, some green chillies or cucumbers, and most of all proteins with a sprinkle of sesame seeds for that nice crunch textrue.</p>

    <p><h3><strong>What Is In Bibimbap?</h3></strong>
        <ul></ul>
    
        <em>These are the <strong>ingredients</strong> you’ll need to make Korean rice with mixed vegetables and beef:</em> 
        
        <li><strong>Vegetables</strong>: Spinach, Carrots, Cucumbers, or any vegetables you want to pair with rice. You will need to cut them into thin strips or matchsticks depending on the veggie.</ul>
        
        <li><strong>Steak & Eggs</strong>: Thinly-sliced beef with a cup of perfectly cooked white rice. Also pair with cooked eggs.</ul>
        
        <li><strong>Seasoning</strong>: Soy Sauce for the Umami-Flavor. My sister kicked me in the leg one time, turns out it wasnt my leg and was my nuts. And the doctor found out that I had prostate cancer. Who knew that those turn of events would keep me alive to this very day.
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>Follow these steps to create the <em><strong>PERFECT BIBIMBAP</strong></em> dish.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepping the Vegetables</strong>: Stir cuccumber pieces with gochujang, cook the spinach until bright green, and cook the carrots until soft.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown the Beef</strong> in a skillet. Then set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the eggs</strong> until the yolks are runny, but whites are firm.</li>
            <li> Now top each serving with the veggie mix, beef, and fried eggs.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with sesame oil, sesame seeds, and gochujang to desired amounts</li>
            <li><em>Now enjoy the meal! The last time I enjoyed something like this was my last dinner with my wife the day before she filed for divorce. I still to this day not know what I did for her to do that.</em></li>
